  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <main>
    <p>Hi, my name is Joshua Shea. I'm an avid gym-goer, who usually wakes up before 5am to get a workout in first thing in the morning. 
      I am also a bit of a movie critic who loves Martin Scorsese films but can only watch half at a time since his movies are so long. 
      I'm ex-military who used to work in Security Forces in the Air Force. I got to travel a bit while I was in. My goals now are to become 
      a software developer and continue to travel other parts of the world and experience other cultures.</p>
